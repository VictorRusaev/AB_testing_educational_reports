# AB_testing_educational_reports
Here are two reports I created while completing the assignment on the "AB testing" course.

Short summary of content:
Mobile game AB test report
The data we have is from 90,189 players that installed the game while the AB-test was running.
The task was to evaluate the average number of game rounds and player’s come back on the first day after installing and on the seventh day after installing.

Revenue increasing AB test report
There was an A/B test proceeding on some web-page.
“Variant” version of the web-page was created to increase revenue from users.
The task was to analyze the raw dataset obtained as a result of this test and provide your suggestions to the manager.
 
Tools I have used:
Jupiter Notebook, Python Pandas, Python Scipy.stats
